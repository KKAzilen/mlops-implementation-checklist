# MLOps Checklist: Model Monitoring & Feedback Loops

This checklist covers everything needed to track, monitor, and improve your models after deployment ‚Äî from detecting drift to collecting user feedback.

---

## Monitoring Model Performance

- [ ] Track model predictions over time (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- [ ] Monitor latency and error rates
- [ ] Log model inputs and outputs for auditing
- [ ] Create dashboards for key model KPIs

---

## Drift Detection

- [ ] Monitor input data distribution vs. training data
- [ ] Detect concept drift using statistical tests or drift detectors
- [ ] Alert teams on significant deviation
- [ ] Automate retraining triggers when thresholds are crossed

---

## Feedback Loops

- [ ] Capture user outcomes or labels post-prediction (if available)
- [ ] Create pipelines to merge feedback with existing datasets
- [ ] Use active learning strategies to improve model over time
- [ ] Flag low-confidence predictions for manual review

---

## Monitoring Compliance and Governance

- [ ] Track model usage per client/region for audit readiness
- [ ] Log feature importance and decision paths for explainability
- [ ] Maintain a changelog of deployed model versions
- [ ] Ensure compliance with industry frameworks (e.g., GxP, MDR, HIPAA, GDPR)
